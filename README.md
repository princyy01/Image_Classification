In this project, we explore the application of the ResNet-50 architecture for image classification on the CIFAR-10 dataset. 
CIFAR-10 is a widely used benchmark dataset containing 60,000 32x32 color images across 10 classes. 
ResNet-50 is a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture known for its effectiveness in image recognition tasks. 

Model Architecture:
1. Input Layer: The model accepts input images of size 3x32x32, representing color images with dimensions 32x32 pixels.
2. ResNet-50 Backbone: The ResNet-50 architecture is instantiated with pretrained weights obtained from the ImageNet dataset. This backbone consists of convolutional layers, batch normalization, ReLU activations, pooling operations, and residual blocks with skip connections.
3. Custom Linear Layer: The last fully connected layer of ResNet-50, designed for ImageNet's 1000-class classification, is substituted with a new linear layer (nn.Linear). This custom layer is configured to output predictions tailored to the CIFAR-10 dataset's class count (10 classes).
4. Output Layer: The output layer produces class predictions for the CIFAR-10 dataset.

Training Procedure:
1. Data Preparation: The CIFAR-10 dataset, comprising 60,000 32x32 color images across 10 classes, is prepared for training.
2. Model Initialization: ResNet-50 is instantiated with pretrained weights, excluding the last fully connected layer.
3. Fine-Tuning: The parameters of the custom linear layer are optimized using backpropagation and gradient descent techniques. The weights of the ResNet-50 backbone are kept frozen during this process to prevent overfitting and preserve pre-learned features.
4. Model Compilation: The model is compiled using appropriate optimization techniques such as the Adam optimizer and cross-entropy loss function.
5. Model Training: The model is trained on the training set, and adjustments to the weights are made iteratively based on the computed loss.
6. Evaluation: The trained model's performance is assessed using a separate validation set.
